Vector Embedding.

 Recommendation Strategy Options
Option 1: Genre-Based Recommendations
Look at genres of movies the user liked.

Recommend unseen movies with similar genres.

Option 2: Embedding-Based (Vector Similarity)
For liked or highly rated rented movies, use the embedding vector to find nearest neighbors (most similar movies).

Quick Win: Genre-Based Recommendations
Letâ€™s implement a SQL + TypeScript-based version for this now.

Step 3: Recommend unseen movies with matching genres

Updated Strategy:
Pull the most recent liked movie (from movie_feedback)

Get its embedding from rented_movies

Use that embedding to call recommendMoviesByVector()

Filter out already liked/disliked movies by this user
